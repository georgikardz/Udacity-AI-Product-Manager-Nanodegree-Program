# Project Overview:

Your goal, as a product owner is to build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children. You'll want to build a classification system that
	•	Can help flag serious cases
	•	Quickly identify healthy cases
	•	And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors

As such, this project is designed to test your ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product. Your main task will be to create a data labeling job using Figure Eight's platform.

# The Data:
The dataset you'll be given is a modified version of this Kaggle chest x-ray dataset, with most labels removed. Every piece of data is a chest x-ray image. You may see images taken that are slightly different in size and taken under slightly different exposure times.
